## Introduction

This project is a **Discord Server Management Dashboard** designed to simplify server administration tasks. It consists of three main components:

1. **Backend**: Built with **Express.js**, it handles Discord API interactions, such as fetching messages, managing roles, and performing moderation actions.
2. **Frontend (HTML)**: A simple HTML-based frontend for basic interactions.
3. **Next.js Frontend**: A modern and responsive dashboard built with **Next.js** that provides a Discord-like interface for managing servers.

The backend interacts with the Discord API using the `discord.js` library, while the frontend provides a seamless user experience for server administrators.

## Features

- **View Server Information**: Fetch and display all connected Discord servers.
- **Channel Management**: List all channels in a server and fetch messages from specific channels.
- **Message Viewer**: View all messages in a channel, including attachments.
- **Audit Logs**: Access and display server audit logs.
- **Member Management**: Kick or ban members with optional reasons.
- **Role Management**: Create and delete roles with custom permissions and colors.
- **Responsive Dashboard**: A modern and intuitive interface built with Next.js.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A Discord bot token (from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suhaib3100/Discord-Bot-Control-Panel.git
   cd Discord-Bot-Control-Panel
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` folder and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - Navigate to the `nextjs-frontend` folder and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd ../nextjs-frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Configure the Backend**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your Discord bot token:
     ```env
     BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
     ```

4. **Run the Backend**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

5. **Run the Next.js Frontend**:
   - Start the Next.js development server:
     ```bash
     cd ../nextjs-frontend
     npm run dev
     ```
   - The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

### Backend Configuration

- The backend uses the `discord.js` library to interact with the Discord API. Ensure your bot has the following permissions:
  - `View Channels`
  - `Read Messages`
  - `Kick Members`
  - `Ban Members`
  - `Manage Roles`
  - `View Audit Log`

- Update the `intents` in the `Client` initialization if additional permissions are required.

### Frontend Configuration

- The Next.js frontend is configured to interact with the backend API. Ensure the backend URL is correctly set in the frontend code (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

---

## Usage

1. **Access the Dashboard**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Log in using your Discord credentials (if applicable).

2. **View Servers**:
   - The dashboard will display all servers your bot is connected to.

3. **Manage Channels**:
   - Select a server to view its channels and messages.

4. **Moderation Actions**:
   - Use the dashboard to kick/ban members, create/delete roles, and view audit logs.

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following REST API endpoints:

- **GET `/api/servers`**: Fetch all connected servers.
- **GET `/api/servers/:serverId/channels`**: Fetch all channels in a server.
- **GET `/api/servers/:serverId/channels/:channelId/messages`**: Fetch all messages in a channel.
- **GET `/api/servers/:serverId/audit-logs`**: Fetch server audit logs.
- **POST `/api/servers/:serverId/members/:memberId/kick`**: Kick a member.
- **POST `/api/servers/:serverId/members/:memberId/ban`**: Ban a member.
- **POST `/api/servers/:serverId/roles`**: Create a new role.
- **DELETE `/api/servers/:serverId/roles/:roleId`**: Delete a role.
